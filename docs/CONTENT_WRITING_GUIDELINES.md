# King John 1205: Content Writing Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Purpose:** Standards for writing event content, dialogue, and narrative text

---

## 1. Core Writing Principles

### 1.1 The Four Pillars

**1. Historical Authenticity**
- Base events on historical record where possible
- Use period-appropriate concerns and language
- Reflect medieval worldview and constraints
- Include accurate details (names, places, customs)

**2. Player Agency**
- Choices must be meaningful
- Avoid obvious "right" answers
- Create genuine dilemmas with trade-offs
- Respect player intelligence

**3. Clarity and Accessibility**
- Medieval tone without archaic language
- Clear consequences for choices
- Accessible to non-historians
- Avoid jargon without explanation

**4. Narrative Engagement**
- Create dramatic tension
- Use vivid, concrete details
- Develop character through dialogue and action
- Make the player care about outcomes

---

## 2. Voice and Tone

### 2.1 Narrative Voice

**Third-Person Limited, Present Tense:**
- Narrator follows King John's perspective
- Present tense for immediacy and engagement
- Omniscient about John's thoughts/feelings
- Limited about others' true intentions

**Example (Good):**
> Marshal enters your chamber, his weathered face grave. You sense his disapproval before he speaks. "My lord, the barons grow restless. Your taxation weighs heavy upon them." You bristle at his tone—does he question your right to rule?

**Example (Bad):**
> William Marshal came into the room. He was unhappy. "King John, the nobles don't like the taxes," he said. John was angry that Marshal criticized him.

### 2.2 Tone Guidelines

**Serious but Not Stuffy:**
- Treat subject matter with respect
- Allow for human moments (humor, warmth, fear)
- Avoid melodrama or overwrought language
- Balance gravitas with readability

**Medieval Without Archaic:**
- ✅ Use: "my lord", "sire", formal address
- ✅ Use: Medieval terms when clear in context (scutage, demesne)
- ❌ Avoid: "thee", "thou", "verily", "forsooth"
- ❌ Avoid: Fake Middle English spelling

**Example (Good):**
> "Sire, the merchant guild of London requests a charter to export wool duty-free. They offer five hundred marks for the privilege."

**Example (Bad):**
> "Good morrow, mine liege! Ye merchants of London do humbly beseech thee grant unto them a charter most fair for the exportation of woollen goods, forsooth!"

### 2.3 Character Voice

**Differentiate Characters Through Speech:**

**William Marshal (cautious, formal):**
> "My lord, I counsel prudence. Philip's forces outnumber ours three to one. Honor does not require foolhardiness."

**William Longespée (bold, loyal, passionate):**
> "Brother, we must strike now! Every day we delay, Philip grows stronger. Give the word and I'll lead the vanguard myself!"

**Geoffrey FitzPeter (practical, administrative):**
> "Sire, the treasury can support a campaign of three months at current rates. Beyond that, we must levy additional scutage or seek loans from the Templars."

**John de Gray (ambitious, politically astute):**
> "My lord, if you install me as Archbishop, the English church will support your policies. Langton, by contrast, will be Rome's man entirely."

---

## 3. Event Structure

### 3.1 Event Description Formula

**Opening → Context → Tension → Choice Moment**

**Opening (1-2 sentences):**
- Set the scene concretely
- Establish location, time, who's present
- Create immediate visual

**Example:**
> A rider arrives from the Welsh Marches, his horse lathered with sweat. He kneels before you in the great hall at Windsor, dust still clinging to his cloak.

**Context (2-4 sentences):**
- Provide necessary background
- Explain what's happening and why it matters
- Include relevant character motivations
- Connect to ongoing situations if applicable

**Example:**
> "My lord," he gasps, "the Welsh prince Llywelyn has raided across the border. Three villages burned, livestock taken. The Marcher lords demand you send troops, but they're already stretched thin guarding against French invasion on the coast."

**Tension (1-2 sentences):**
- Raise stakes
- Present the dilemma
- Show conflicting pressures
- Create urgency

**Example:**
> Your counselors murmur. If you ignore this, the Marchers will see you as weak—but deploying troops westward means leaving the southern coast vulnerable to Philip's fleet.

**Choice Moment (1 sentence):**
- Direct question or statement of decision point
- Transition to choices

**Example:**
> You must decide how to respond.

**Total Length: 100-300 words**

### 3.2 Choice Writing

**Format:**
- Active voice, imperative mood
- Clear statement of action
- 10-25 words
- Indicates resource requirements if applicable

**Good Choices:**
```
1. Send royal troops to punish the Welsh raiders
   [Requires: Military Readiness > 60]

2. Order the Marcher lords to handle it themselves

3. Negotiate with Llywelyn, offering concessions for peace

4. Ignore the raid—you have larger concerns with France
```

**Bad Choices:**
```
1. You could maybe send some troops to Wales if you want

2. The Marcher lords can deal with it I guess

3. Perhaps negotiating would be wise?

4. Do nothing (this might be bad)
```

### 3.3 Outcome Writing

**Formula: Action → Immediate Result → Consequence → Future Implication**

**Action (1-2 sentences):**
- Describe what John does
- Show the decision being enacted

**Immediate Result (2-3 sentences):**
- What happens right away
- Reactions of key characters
- Concrete details of outcome

**Consequence (1-2 sentences):**
- Resource/relationship changes explained narratively
- "Why" these changes happened

**Future Implication (1 sentence, optional):**
- Hint at potential future effects
- Set up possible triggered events

**Example:**
> You dispatch a strong force of royal knights under Roger de Lacy to harry the Welsh. Within a fortnight, word returns: the raiders have been driven back across the border, and Llywelyn's hall at Aberffraw has been burned in retaliation.
>
> The Marcher lords are pleased by your swift action, and your authority in the region is reinforced. However, the campaign has cost you dearly—eight hundred marks for wages and supplies, and the troops are now unavailable for the planned Normandy invasion.
>
> Worse, your chancellor reports that Llywelyn has sent envoys to King Philip, seeking an alliance against you. This Welsh problem may not be over.

**Total Length: 50-150 words**

## 4. Historical Accuracy Standards

### 4.1 Research Sources

**Primary Source (Required):**
- The provided PDF: "King John's Movements and Activities in 1205"
- Use this as the backbone for historical events

**Secondary Sources (Recommended):**
- W.L. Warren, "King John" (standard biography)
- Ralph Turner, "King John: England's Evil King?"
- Contemporary chronicles: Roger of Wendover, Ralph of Coggeshall
- Magna Carta Project (online resource)

**When in Doubt:**
- Mark content as "plausible historical fiction"
- Prefer understatement to exaggeration
- Include disclaimer in historical notes if speculative

### 4.2 Anachronism Avoidance

**Common Pitfalls:**

❌ **Modern Concepts:**
- Democracy, human rights, nationalism
- "The people demand representation"
- Psychological terminology
- Modern military tactics/technology

✅ **Period Concepts:**
- Feudal obligations, oaths, honor
- "The barons claim ancient liberties"
- Humoral theory, sin/virtue framework
- Medieval siege warfare, cavalry charges

❌ **Modern Language:**
- "Okay," "yeah," "guys"
- "The king needs to think outside the box"
- Modern idioms

✅ **Period-Appropriate:**
- "Very well," "aye," "my lords"
- "The king must seek novel counsel"
- Medieval metaphors (biblical, classical, natural)

### 4.3 Historical Context Notes

**Every major historical event should include optional context:**

**Format:**
```
Historical Context:

[2-4 sentence explanation of what really happened]

[Why it mattered / consequences]

[Optional: Modern scholarly perspective]

Source: [Citation]
```

**Example:**
```
Historical Context:

King John's failed invasion of 1205 was caused by baronial refusal to
serve overseas. Many nobles had already lost their Norman estates in
1204 and saw no benefit in fighting for lands they no longer held. John's
inability to compel their service demonstrated the limits of royal power.

This failure contributed to growing tensions between John and his
barons, as he continued to levy heavy taxes for military campaigns that
never materialized. The resentment from 1205 would eventually
contribute to the Magna Carta crisis of 1215.

Modern historians debate whether John could have succeeded if the
invasion had launched—most argue Philip's position in Normandy was
too strong by 1205.

Source: W.L. Warren, "King John", pp. 142-147
```

### 4.4 Balancing History and Gameplay

**Fixed History vs. Player Agency:**

**Historical Anchors (Mostly Fixed):**
- Deaths of real people (Hubert Walter)
- Major political structures
- Geographic reality
- General historical trajectory

**Player Can Influence:**
- Outcomes of major decisions (invasion success/failure)
- Relationships with barons
- Financial state of kingdom
- Regional stability
- Personal reputation

**Handling Divergence:**
- Acknowledge when player diverges from history
- "Historical path" flag for accuracy-minded players
- Alternate history events for divergent timelines
- End-of-year comparison: "Your 1205" vs. "Historical 1205"

---

## 5. Writing Different Event Types

### 5.1 Historical Anchor Events

**Characteristics:**
- Tied to specific dates
- Based on documented occurrences
- Higher word count (200-300 words)
- Multiple meaningful choices
- Significant consequences
- Historical context included

**Approach:**
1. Research the historical event thoroughly
2. Identify the key decision point or moment
3. Imagine John's perspective and pressures
4. Create choices that could plausibly have been considered
5. Write consequences for both historical and alternate outcomes

**Example Template:**
```
Event: [Historical Moment]
Date: [Specific Date]
Description: [Set scene, provide context, create tension - 200+ words]
Choices:
  1. [Historical action] - leads to historical outcome
  2. [Plausible alternative] - alternate history branch
  3. [Another alternative] - different alternate path
  4. [Cautious/moderate option] - middle ground
Historical Note: [What actually happened and why it mattered]
```

### 5.2 Triggered Events

**Characteristics:**
- Fire when conditions met (low treasury, low loyalty, etc.)
- Reactive rather than scheduled
- Address specific game state situations
- Often short to medium length (150-200 words)
- Clear cause-and-effect

**Approach:**
1. Identify the triggering condition (e.g., Treasury < 2000)
2. Create a realistic scenario caused by that condition
3. Offer choices to address or mitigate the problem
4. Include at least one risky choice that could make things worse

**Example:**
```
Trigger: Treasury < 2000 for 7+ days
Event: A Plea from the Exchequer

Geoffrey FitzPeter brings grim news: the royal treasury is nearly
exhausted. Wages for your mercenaries are overdue, and the sheriffs
report that further taxation will likely provoke unrest. You must
find funds quickly or risk losing your military force—or worse,
rebellion.

Choices:
1. Demand emergency scutage from all barons (quick money, harms loyalty)
2. Borrow from the Templars at interest (debt problem for later)
3. Sell royal privileges and charters (reduces authority)
4. Cut military spending dramatically (reduces readiness)
```

### 5.3 Random Events

**Characteristics:**
- Add variety and unpredictability
- Not tied to specific dates or conditions
- Often shorter (100-150 words)
- Range from opportunities to minor crises
- Provide texture and color to the year

**Approach:**
1. Think of plausible medieval occurrences
2. Create interesting but not game-defining consequences
3. Allow for player personality to show through choices
4. Balance positive, negative, and neutral events

**Categories:**
- **Opportunities:** Unexpected good fortune, advantageous offers
- **Minor Crises:** Problems requiring attention but not catastrophic
- **Character Moments:** Personal/social situations
- **Flavor:** World-building, atmospheric events with minor choices

**Example (Flavor):**
```
Event: The Royal Hunt

While at Woodstock, your master of the hunt reports an exceptional
white stag sighted in the forest—a creature of legendary beauty.
Your courtiers urge you to hunt it personally, but your chaplain
warns that white stags are blessed by God and killing one brings
misfortune. How will you spend the day?

Choices:
1. Hunt the stag yourself—fortune favors the bold
   [+5 Authority if successful, +10 to regional relationship]
2. Let the stag go and hunt ordinary game
   [+3 Church favor, modest enjoyment]
3. Focus on governance instead of leisure
   [+200 treasury from efficient administration]
```

### 5.4 Event Templates

**Characteristics:**
- Repeatable structure with variable content
- Fill-in-the-blank format
- Generated dynamically
- Lightweight (100 words or less)
- Handle routine governance

**Common Templates:**

**A) Petitioner Request:**
```
[PETITIONER_NAME], a [PETITIONER_TYPE] from [LOCATION], kneels before
you requesting a royal charter to [ACTIVITY]. [He/She] offers
[AMOUNT] marks for this privilege.

Your advisors note that granting this could [POSITIVE_EFFECT] but
may also [NEGATIVE_EFFECT].

Choices:
1. Grant the charter and accept the payment
   [+Treasury, +Regional Stability]
2. Grant it for free (generous)
   [+Relationship with petitioner, +Popular Support]
3. Refuse the request
   [No cost, no benefit]
```

**Variables:**
- PETITIONER_NAME: Generated from period name list
- PETITIONER_TYPE: merchant, knight, abbott, mayor
- LOCATION: Random from location list
- ACTIVITY: establish market, build mill, export goods, etc.
- AMOUNT: 50-500 marks (based on request type)

**B) Intelligence Report:**
```
Your scouts bring news from [REGION]: [INTELLIGENCE_TYPE].

[ELABORATION] This development could have implications for your
[AFFECTED_INTEREST].

Choices:
1. Respond with military force
2. Send diplomatic envoys
3. Monitor the situation but take no action
4. Consult advisors for recommendations
```

**Implementation:**
- Create a template with placeholders
- Define lists of valid values for each placeholder
- Generate instances by randomly selecting values
- Ensure combinations make narrative sense

### 5.5 Multi-Day Event Chains

**Characteristics:**
- Span 5-15 days
- Tell a complete story arc
- Multiple decision points
- Build narrative momentum
- Major historical moments expanded

**Structure:**

**Day 1 (Setup):**
- Introduce situation
- Establish stakes
- Initial context
- Minor or no choice (mostly exposition)

**Days 2-N (Development):**
- Situation evolves based on Day 1 choice
- New complications arise
- Smaller decisions along the way
- Information gathering

**Day N-1 (Crisis):**
- Major decision point
- Climax of the chain
- Most significant choice
- High stakes

**Day N (Resolution):**
- Outcomes of major decision
- Consequences play out
- Narrative wrap-up
- Set flags for future

**Example: Pentecost Invasion Chain (10 days)**
```
Day 1 (June 1): Arrival at Portsmouth
  - Set scene, begin mustering forces
  - Choice: Push barons or be patient?

Day 3 (June 3): Baronial Complaints Begin
  - Marshal expresses concerns
  - Choice: Reassure, threaten, or ignore?

Day 5 (June 5): PENTECOST - Invasion Decision
  - MAJOR CHOICE: Launch, cancel, or compromise?
  - Biggest consequences of the chain

Day 7 (June 7): Dealing with Aftermath
  - Handle consequences of Day 5 choice
  - If launched: supply issues
  - If canceled: baronial compensation

Day 10 (June 10): Chain Resolution
  - Final state established
  - Set flags for rest of year
  - Narrative closure
```

**Writing Chain Events:**
1. Plan the full arc before writing individual events
2. Ensure choices from early events affect later events
3. Track chain-specific flags
4. Create satisfying resolution
5. Test the full chain as a unit

---

## 6. Choice Design

### 6.1 Creating Meaningful Choices

**Avoid These Choice Pitfalls:**

❌ **Obvious Trap:**
```
1. Execute all the barons
2. Negotiate fairly
3. Seek peaceful compromise
```
(Choice 1 is clearly terrible)

❌ **False Choice:**
```
1. March north to York
2. Travel north to York
3. Journey north to York
```
(All choices lead to the same outcome)

❌ **Obscure Choice:**
```
1. Invoke the Assize of Clarendon
2. Apply the Constitutions of Clarendon
3. Cite the Treaty of Le Goulet
```
(Requires external knowledge to understand)

✅ **Good Dilemma:**
```
1. Pay the ransom for the captured knight (costly but honorable)
2. Refuse and leave him to his fate (cheaper but dishonorable)
3. Attempt a rescue (risky but could be heroic)
4. Negotiate for lower price (moderate risk and cost)
```
(All choices have clear trade-offs)

### 6.2 Trade-Off Matrix

**Every choice should have pros AND cons:**

| Choice | Immediate Benefit | Immediate Cost | Long-term Risk | Long-term Opportunity |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Raise Taxes | +Treasury | -Loyalty | Rebellion | More military |
| Lower Taxes | +Loyalty | -Treasury | Weakness | Goodwill |
| Compromise | Moderate both | Moderate both | Uncertainty | Flexibility |

**Avoid:**
- Pure win choices (all upside, no downside)
- Pure loss choices (all downside, no upside)
- Dominant strategies (always optimal choice)

### 6.3 Choice Categories

**Provide variety in choice types:**

**Strategic Choices:**
- Long-term planning
- Major resource allocation
- Setting policy direction

**Tactical Choices:**
- Immediate problem-solving
- Reactive decisions
- Crisis management

**Character Choices:**
- Define John's personality
- Show values and priorities
- Build narrative identity
  - Merciful or ruthless?
  - Pragmatic or principled?
  - Cautious or bold?

**Meta Choices:**
- Consult advisors
- Gather more information
- Delay decision

**Example Balanced Set:**
```
1. [Strategic] Launch the invasion now (big gamble, long-term impact)
2. [Tactical] Send small force first (moderate risk, tactical choice)
3. [Character] Honor your commitment despite objections (principled)
4. [Meta] Consult with Marshal privately before deciding (info-gathering)
```

### 6.4 Requirements and Locked Choices

**Use sparingly and purposefully:**

**When to Lock Choices:**
- Resource requirement prevents action (not enough money/troops)
- Relationship threshold (can't negotiate with hostile baron)
- Prior choice consequence (burned bridge can't be unburned)
- Historical realism (can't do impossible things)

**How to Indicate:**
```
1. Send 2,000 troops to Normandy
   [LOCKED: Military Readiness too low (need 75, have 60)]

2. Ask William Marshal for support
   [LOCKED: Marshal relationship too poor (need 50, have 30)]
```

**Always provide alternative:**
- Never lock all choices
- Ensure at least 2-3 choices always available
- Locked choices show consequence of prior decisions
- Creates meaningful strategic planning

---

## 7. Advisor Dialogue

### 7.1 Advisor Personalities (Review)

**William Marshal:**
- **Voice:** Formal, measured, experienced
- **Concerns:** Honor, military practicality, feudal obligations
- **Bias:** Cautious, prefers diplomacy
- **Speech Pattern:** "My lord, I counsel..."

**William Longespée:**
- **Voice:** Passionate, loyal, direct
- **Concerns:** Military glory, family loyalty, personal honor
- **Bias:** Aggressive, favors action
- **Speech Pattern:** "Brother, we must..."

**Geoffrey FitzPeter:**
- **Voice:** Pragmatic, administrative, detail-oriented
- **Concerns:** Treasury, law, bureaucracy
- **Bias:** Practical, focuses on feasibility
- **Speech Pattern:** "Sire, the treasury shows..."

**John de Gray:**
- **Voice:** Ambitious, politically astute, loyal to John
- **Concerns:** Church politics, personal advancement
- **Bias:** Assertive royal authority over church
- **Speech Pattern:** "My lord, consider that..."

**Intelligence Officer:**
- **Voice:** Neutral, professional, factual
- **Concerns:** Accurate reporting
- **Bias:** None (just reports)
- **Speech Pattern:** "My scouts report..."

**Queen Isabella:**
- **Voice:** Young but shrewd, protective
- **Concerns:** Family, dynasty, court politics
- **Bias:** Long-term stability, children's future
- **Speech Pattern:** "My lord husband..."

### 7.2 Writing Advisor Counsel

**Format:**
```
[Advisor Name] counsels:
"[Advice in character voice, 2-4 sentences]"
```

**Guidelines:**
- Each advisor should have distinct perspective
- Advisors can disagree with each other
- Advice based on their expertise and personality
- Relationship affects enthusiasm (low relationship = terse)

**Example (Same Event, Different Advisors):**

**Event:** Should you attend the Christmas court or stay on campaign in Wales?

**William Marshal:**
> "My lord, Christmas court is a sacred duty of kingship. Your absence would be noted—and resented—by the barons and clergy alike. We can resume the campaign in spring."

**William Longespée:**
> "Brother, we have the Welsh on the run! If we pull back now, we'll lose all we've gained. Send your regrets and press the advantage while we have it."

**Geoffrey FitzPeter:**
> "Sire, the Christmas court is when feudal obligations are renewed and charters sealed. Skipping it could cost you revenue and legal authority. Practically speaking, you should attend."

**Queen Isabella:**
> "My lord husband, our children expect to see you at Christmas. It is one of the few times the court gathers as a family. Please, do not let war take you from them again."

### 7.3 Relationship-Based Responses

**High Relationship (70+):**
- Enthusiastic, detailed advice
- Offers personal support
- Volunteers additional help

**Medium Relationship (40-69):**
- Professional, neutral advice
- Fulfills duties appropriately
- No extra effort

**Low Relationship (15-39):**
- Terse, minimal advice
- Hints of disapproval
- Barely concealed reluctance

**Very Low (<15):**
- Refuses to advise, or
- Actively misleading advice
- Open hostility

**Example (Marshal at Different Relationship Levels):**

**High (75):**
> "My lord, I speak as one who has served three kings: this course is dangerous, but I understand why you must take it. If you command, I will stand with you to the end, and bring all my knights to your banner."

**Medium (55):**
> "Sire, I counsel caution in this matter. The risks are considerable. I will serve as required, but I urge you to reconsider."

**Low (25):**
> "You ask my counsel, my lord? Very well: this is folly. But I see you are determined. I will discharge my obligations, nothing more."

## 9. Example: Complete Event Walkthrough

### 9.1 Event Creation Process

**Step 1: Choose Historical Moment**
From PDF: March 15, 1205 - John travels from Burbage to Marlborough

**Step 2: Research Context**
- Marlborough was a favorite residence
- Spring military preparations ongoing
- Would be receiving reports, making plans
- Good time for administrative decision

**Step 3: Develop Scenario**
Create a plausible event fitting the date/context:
A delegation from the Cinque Ports requesting more funds for ship-building, but treasury is strained from military prep.

**Step 4: Draft Description**

> **The Cinque Ports Petition**
>
> You arrive at Marlborough Castle after a cold ride through the early spring mud. Before you can even settle in, a delegation from the Cinque Ports is announced—merchants and ship-masters from Dover, Sandwich, and Hastings, travel-worn and urgent.
>
> Their spokesman, a grizzled captain named Edmund, kneels and presents their petition: "Sire, you have commanded us to build twenty new galleys for your fleet. We are loyal subjects and will obey, but the cost is ruinous. Timber, iron fittings, sailcloth, wages for shipwrights—it amounts to near three thousand marks. We beg your majesty provide funds, or at least reduce the number of ships required."
>
> Geoffrey FitzPeter murmurs in your ear: the treasury is already strained from recruiting mercenaries and stockpiling arms. But William of Wrotham, your keeper of the galleys, insists the ships are essential—without naval superiority, Philip could invade England itself.
>
> The Cinque Ports men wait for your answer. Their loyalty is proven, but their resources are not infinite.

**Step 5: Design Choices with Trade-offs**

```
1. Provide the full 3,000 marks from the royal treasury
   [Requires: Treasury > 3000]
   (+Naval power, +Cinque Ports loyalty, -Treasury, authority maintained)

2. Provide 1,500 marks and reduce ship order to 12 galleys
   (Compromise: moderate costs, moderate benefits)

3. Refuse funding—they must build the ships at their own cost
   (+Authority, -Cinque Ports loyalty, -Naval power eventually)

4. Grant them a trade exemption worth 1,000 marks instead of cash
   (Creative solution: indirect cost, trading future revenue)
```

**Step 6: Write Outcomes**

*[Each outcome 50-150 words, showing immediate result and consequences]*

**Step 7: Add Historical Note**

> Historical Context:
>
> King John did expand the English fleet significantly in 1205, appointing William of Wrotham as "keeper of the galleys." The Cinque Ports—Dover, Sandwich, Hastings, Romney, and Hythe—had a feudal obligation to provide ships for royal service, but were often granted privileges and exemptions in return. John's naval expansion was crucial for defending against French invasion, and by late 1205 he had assembled around 50 galleys. This military preparation was one of his more successful initiatives during an otherwise difficult year.

**Step 8: Technical Implementation**

```python
MARCH_15_CINQUE_PORTS = Event(
    event_id="march_15_cinque_ports_petition",
    event_type="historical",
    title="The Cinque Ports Petition",
    date=(1205, 3, 15),
    location="Marlborough",
    description="""[Full text above]""",
    choices=[
        Choice(
            choice_id=1,
            text="Provide the full 3,000 marks from the royal treasury",
            requirements={"resources": {"treasury": 3000}},
            consequences={
                "resources": {
                    "treasury": -3000,
                    "military_readiness": 8
                },
                "regions": {
                    "southern_england": 5
                }
            },
            narrative_outcome="""[Outcome text]"""
        ),
        # ... other choices
    ],
    historical_context="""[Context above]"""
)
```

- Play through event in game
- Verify all choices work
- Check consequences apply correctly
- Proofread one more time

**Step 10: Finalize**
- Mark event as complete
- Add to event database
- Update documentation

### 11.3 Tone Examples by Event Type

**High Drama (Major Historical Event):**
> The tent falls silent. Fifty galleys lie at anchor, an army waits to embark, and Philip of France sits unchallenged in your ancestral duchy. Yet before you stand a dozen barons—men who owe you service—refusing to sail. Marshal's face is grave. Your brother Longespée's hand rests on his sword hilt. The moment of decision has come.

**Administrative (Routine Event):**
> A minor landowner from Sussex presents a dispute over mill rights. The local sheriff has ruled against him, and he seeks your justice. It's a tedious matter, but ruling well in small things maintains your authority in large ones.

**Personal/Social (Character Moment):**
> Queen Isabella finds you in the private garden at Windsor. "You've been closeted with your advisors for days," she says gently. "Come, walk with me. The world will still be there in an hour." You see the concern in her eyes—and perhaps an opportunity to speak of matters beyond war and money.
